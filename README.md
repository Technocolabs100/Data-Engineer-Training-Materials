### Prerequisites

To get most out of this course, you should feel comfortable with coding and command line,
and know the basics of SQL. Prior experience with Python will be helpful, but you can pick 
Python relatively fast if you have experience with other programming languages.

Prior experience with data engineering is not required.


## Tools 

For this course you'll need to have the following software installed on your computer:

* Docker and Docker-Compose
* Python 3 (e.g. via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual))
* Google Cloud SDK 
* Terraform

See [Week 1](week_1_basics_n_setup) for more details about installing these tools
